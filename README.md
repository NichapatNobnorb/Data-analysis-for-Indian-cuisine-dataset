# Data-analysis-for-Indian-cuisine-dataset
This is final project in my class (CPE329 - Business Intelligence)

## Introduction
I thinks that I is restaurant operators who want to offer a menu so that customers who come to the restaurant are impressed with the food of the restaurant. 

## Detail
I use dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/indian-food-101 (Data about 255 traditional and famous dishes in india) to run model

I've set up the following Business Question:

predictive Business Question : What menu items can we recommend to our customers that are suitable and satisfying?

descriptive Business Question: What is the relationship between the ingredients of the menu and the landscape?

## Organizational memory
For this analysis, we chose to use Customer information (CRM) to collect customer data and group or observe trends. The information that needs to be collected is as follows:
Customer name, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Address, Taste, Favorite ingredients, Food allergy

##  Information integration
Due to Customer personal information may not be sufficient for prediction. I therefore need external data to build or develop a more accurate model. The technology used is Web mining and Text mining.
